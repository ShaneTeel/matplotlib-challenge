## Objectives
By the end of this article you will be able to:

- find examples of common plots and visualizations that may be useful to you 
- replicate plots and visualizations in matplotlib

## Choosing a visualization
You have likely seen many different kinds of plots, graphs, and visualizations. You may have in mind one that would be useful to your line of work or a specific point you are trying to convey.

It's helpful to have a visual vocabulary of what is available to you. The matplotlib gallery demonstrates many common visualizations and includes code that you can use as a starting point for developing your own.
